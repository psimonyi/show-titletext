# Show comic title-text

Show the title-text below a comic page.  Instead of having to hover the mouse
to read it, the text is just there already.  Actually, it doesn't have to be a
comic — you can turn this on for any domain.

This is a WebExtension for desktop Firefox.  (It ought to work on Firefox for
Android too, but several of the WebExtensions APIs are not implemented there.)

## Usage

Since many images have title-text, you have to set which image on which domains
is a comic with interesting title-text.  The easy way to add rules is with the
context menu: right-click on a comic and pick "Set title-text rule with this
image".

You can edit (or manually create) rules in the add-on preferences.  Each domain
is associated with a CSS selector identifying the comic image.  For example,
`#comic > img` would work for xkcd.com.

Once you've finished adding most rules, you can remove the context menu entry
from the add-on preferences.
